    Members and Friends of AMA Atlanta
  </h1>
  <p>
    This year marks the 59th year of the AMA Atlanta’s Amy Awards and once again, we are celebrating the achievements of our community.  
  </p>
  <p>
    What's especially wonderful about the AMY Awards is that we celebrate marketers and marketing of all kinds. Awards go to the top high school students in DECA Marketing Programs around the state; to college students who have excelled in their studies and in their contributions to their AMA Atlanta collegiate chapters; to brand marketers and agencies who have demonstrated excellence in their work from digital marketing and branding to social media and analytics; and to marketers who devote their gifts and resources to benefit others.
  </p>
  <p>
    We could not do what we do at AMA Atlanta without the generous support of our Board of Directors, Executive Advisory Board, volunteers and sponsors, so thank you all for making AMA Atlanta a strong and vital in organization.
  </p>
  <p> 
    Tonight's event would not be possible without the tireless work of Keshawn Hughes, the Chairman of tonight’s AMY Awards and the entire AMY Awards Committee
  </p>
  <p>
    Thanks also go to the 2016 AMY Awards Panel of Judges, our generous sponsors and everyone who took the time to submit an entry for one of tonight's awards. 
  </p>
  <p>
    I hope you enjoy the evening and come away with lots of pride in our wonderful Atlanta market in community.
  </p>
